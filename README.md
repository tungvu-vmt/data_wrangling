## Assignment 1: Text Data Wrangling and Analysis

Description: This assignment focuses on parsing and transforming semi-structured text data from Google reviews, analyzing review content, and preparing it for natural language processing.

### Tasks:

1. Parsing Raw Files: Extract data from .txt and .xlsx files, converting them into structured CSV and JSON formats. Fields include review information, business IDs, and ratings.
2. Text Pre-Processing: Preprocess review text to generate numerical representations, including creating a vocabulary list and token frequencies for text analysis.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to uncover insights from Google Review data, focusing on trends and patterns.
4. Presentation: Summarize EDA findings in a video format, highlighting key insights with visualizations.
5. Development History: Document assignment progress with version histories to track changes and collaborative efforts.

## Assignment 2: Data Cleansing and Transformation

Description: This assignment addresses data quality issues in transactional retail data, focusing on error detection, outlier removal, and data imputation to prepare for analysis.

### Tasks:

1. Data Cleansing: Identify and fix anomalies in data (errors, missing values, outliers) for attributes such as delivery charges and customer satisfaction scores.
2. Data Reshaping: Use normalization and transformation techniques on property data to prepare for predictive modeling of house prices.
3. Reflective Report: Document methodology, reflect on feedback received during development, and identify future improvements.
