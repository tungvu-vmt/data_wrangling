Tokenization\n","2. Context-independent stopwords and short tokens removal\n","3. Rare tokens and context-dependent stopwords removal\n","4. Generate top 200 bigrams\n","5. Stemming unigram and keep bigram intact\n","6. Calculate vocabulary including both unigrams and bigrams\n","7. Create a sparse matrix and CountVector\n","\n","The rationale for that specific order of processing is as followed.\n","1. **Tokenization**: This step breaks the text into individual tokens. This is being done first because it's fundamental for all subsequent text processing steps.\n","\n","2. **Context-independent stopwords and short tokens removal**: This step removes common stopwords (such as \"and\", \"the\", etc.) and short tokens, which are assumed to be meaningless. This step is being done before **Rare token and context-dependent stopwords removal** because removing stopwords and short tokens early can reduces the dataset size quickly. These common stopwords and short tokens don't add much value to the analysis so removing them would simplies the following steps.\n","\n","3. **Rare token and context-dependent stopwords removal**: Rare tokens and context-dependent stopwords are removed to further clean the data. Rare tokens and context-dependent stopwords are defined as having document frequency of less than 5% and more than 95% respectively. Rare tokens can introduce noise while context-dependent stopwords (words that appear in almost every document) don't provide meaningful information for analysis.\n","\n","4. **Generating top 200 bigrams**: Top 200 bigrams based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) are added into the list of tokens.\n","\n","**Remarks:** Stopwords and rare tokens removal was done before generating bigrams to prevent noise in bigrams and reduce the computing load. Stopwords and rare tokens don't have much meaning and if they were kept when generating bigrams, meaningless bigrams like \"of the\", \"and it\" would be generated. Removing stopwords and rare tokens early on also reduce the number of potential bigrams.\n","\n","5. **Stemming unigram and keep bigram intact**: This step stems unigram to its root form using PorterStemmer. Bigrams are kept intact to preserve the specific word combinations that could lose meaning if stemmed.\n","\n","**Remarks:** Stemming was done after stopwords (context-dependent and independent) removal to avoid stemming irrelevant words and altering the document frequency of some words. Since stemming return words to its root form, some words may experience an increased in document frequency compare to its original forms. For example, the words \"run\", \"running\", and \"runs\" which has document frequency 1 in three documents, after stemming to \"run\", the word \"run\" will have document frequency of 3. Context-dependent stopwords and rare tokens are defined based on document frequency, thus with changed document frequency, removing context-dependent and rare tokens would be inaccurate.\n","\n","6. **Calculate vocabulary including both unigrams and bigrams**: Combining the cleaned and processed unigrams and bigrams into a final vocabulary list ensures that your text analysis captures both individual word meanings and important word combinations.\n","\n","7. **Create a sparse matrix and CountVector**: Finally, the creation of a sparse matrix using CountVectorizer transforms the vocabulary into a numerical format, ready for machine learning models or other quantitative analysis.\n","\n","The details of each steps are below.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"XYupCbAY044C"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n","    \n","### 4.2.

The preprocessing pipeline involved several key steps:\n","\n","1. Data Loading and Initial Exploration: We started by loading data from a CSV file containing business-related information and a JSON file containing detailed review data. We ensured that the review texts were normalized, free of emojis, and in English.\n","\n","2. Text Processing: The core text processing tasks were systematically executed, including tokenization, stopwords removal, and stemming. We also identified and removed rare tokens and context-dependent stopwords to clean the dataset effectively.\n","\n","3. Bigram Generation and Integration: We generated the top 200 bigrams based on Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) and integrated these into our vocabulary, maintaining the meaning of specific word combinations.\n","\n","4. Vocabulary Creation and Sparse Matrix Generation: A final vocabulary list, comprising both unigrams and bigrams, was generated. Using this vocabulary, we created a sparse matrix and a corresponding CountVector, which were outputted for further analysis.\n","\n","Overall, the structured and detailed approach taken in this notebook provided a solid foundation for further text analysis, ensuring that the processed data is in a format suitable for machine learning models and other quantitative analyses."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"HppxDtWNlDEn"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n","    \n","## 7.
